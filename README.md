# Sorting Algorithm for Integer Arrays

We implement 3 sorting algorithms for integer arrays.

## Bubble Sort

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts the array in ascending order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.

## Radix Sort

The Radio Sort algorithm sorts the array in the correct order.

The algorithm is implemented in C.
